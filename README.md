- 👋 Hi, I’m @RevLuis
-   I live in Los Angeles and have worked as a bartender/server for most of my life. I'm 47 years old and, apart from everyday computer usage, I'm new to the world of coding. 
-   
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
-   Learmimg as much as I can about coding. I really enjoy the aha moments of my studies. Finally figuring out something that has had me stumped is a breath of fresh air. I hope to further my knowledge until I can translate it into a completely new career. I'm currently taking the self teaching route. That's making the obstacles I encounter feel overwhelming at times, but I'm pushing past that and benefitting from that persistence.
-   
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
-   Right now it's the basics. I've learned (and still learning) HTML and CSS. I'm currently deep into my JavaScript lessons. I picked up some Python and REALLY enjoyed that. It reminded me of grade school when I learned a little BASIC. (Yes that makes me super old.) I hope to go back to Python and other languages as eventually I want to do more than build web sites.
-   
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
-   Currently I don't feel strong enough in my knowledge of ANY language to collaborate on any large projects, but as I explore Github and the larger world of coding, I do hope to not only work on projects with people from around the world, but also get to know people in the community.
